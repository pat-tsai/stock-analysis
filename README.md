# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project was to analyze stock performance through refactoring previously constructed code, which would analyze the total daily volume and return rate of 12 different stock tickers. Theses tickers were organized in alphabetical order in contiguous rows, and there was no excess junk data that required cleaning prior to the analysis. The starter code is able to successfully complete the task, however, it may prove inefficient for larger volumes of data due to its nested for loops. Ultimately, refactoring this code allows us to perform the task significantly faster, and handle larger volumes of data.


## Results
### Analysis of stock performance
Based on the analysis, we can observe a general positive trend in 2017 where all but 1 stock ticker had net positive returns. In contrast, the results from 2018 show all tickers having negative returns with the exception of 2 stocks.

Furthermore, the visualizations reveal that there is a correlation between higher total volume contributing to net positive returns. In general, stock tickers that had high net positive returns and  tend to have higher daily volumes traded. However, there were some tickers including DQ, HASI, SEDG, and VSLR that had a negative return rate despite increasing their total daily volume from 2017 to 2018. This indicates that there were additional factors that affect the return rate outcome.

In conclusion, stock tickers ENPH and RUN seem to be doing quite well, having a positive return rate despite all other companies having negative returns. It would be interesting to evaluate and see if there is a common theme resulting in these negative rates.


### Comparing time taken before and after refactoring

Initially, the complete analysis took about 0.65 seconds to complete. Upon refactoring the code, the running time was significantly reduced, requiring <0.01 second for each year. The key changes that increased its efficiency were utilizing arrays to store the ticker volumes, as well as starting and ending prices, allowing us to remove the nested for loops in the unrefactored code. See below for key differences.

Unrefactored pseudocode with nested for loop:
```
4) Loop through tickers
   For i = 0 to 11
       ticker = tickers(i)
       totalVolume = 0
       
       '5) loop through rows in the data
        For j = 2 to RowCount
           '5a) Get total volume for current ticker
           '5b) get starting price for current ticker
           '5c) get ending price for current ticker
        Next j
        
       '6) Output data for current ticker
   Next i
```

Refactored code utilizing arrays and separating the nested loop:
```
    For i = 2 To RowCount
        '7a) Increase volume for current ticker
        tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
       
        '7b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
        '7c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
            '7d Increase the tickerIndex.
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
        End If
    Next i
    
    '8) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
    For i = 0 To 11
        ...
    Next i
```

## Summary
### General pros and cons of refactoring code
In general, it is beneficial to refactor code to fix existing bugs, optimize efficiency, or even add new features. This is especially pertinent for code that has been used for many years and may slowly become outdated. Refactoring code can also make it easier for the next programmer to read, allowing for it to be easily understood and further updated. However, refactoring existing, functional code also comes with cons. These include new bugs that may be introduced, or changing a line of code that could potentially break the whole program. In addition, although unrefactored code may not be efficient, it is possible it has been proven to be functional by undergoing numerous test cases. These test cases may not be available to be used on the newly refactored code, resulting in failure after it has been implemented.  

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA scripts
By refactoring the original VBA script, we are now able to analyze much larger datasets at a much faster speed. There were not many cons for refactoring this code other than having to perform some debugging to complete the refactored code. However despite these changes, we are still unable to analyze tickers other than the 12 hardcoded tickers within the ticker array. If we were given additional ticker data, we would have to expand the size of that ticker array. In addition, limitations of both the original and refactored code is that the data must be cleaned with no missing values. This is due to the line `RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row` which determines the total number of rows in the document. If the excel data were not clean and had missing or "nan" values, the for loop `For i = 2 To RowCount` would not iterate through the entire document. Lastly, in both the original and refactored code the data must be listed in contigious rows. This is because of the following logic: 
```
    '6b) loop over all the rows
    For i = 2 To RowCount
    
        '7a) Increase volume for current ticker
        tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
        
        '7b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
                
        End If
        
        '7c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            
            tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
            
            '7d Increase the tickerIndex.
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
            
        End If
    
    Next i
```
As shown in the code above, if ticker data were scrambled throughout the excel document and not listed in adjacent blocks, the ticker index would be prematurely incremented resulting in faulty data.
